## Why
I wanted an Telegram message and email when the power went out at any of my sites.

## How
There are only two requirements here, SMTP server for sending emails and Telegram API + ConversationID for sending the messages to Telegram. 

## Telegram
I can't cover the methods of creating Bots or getting your conversation ID from Telegram because these methods may change in the future. Here are the basic steps:
1. Create Telegram Bot, get the Bot Token ID
2. Create a conversation or channel, get the ID


## Variables
Here is a list of variables to edit for normal operation
